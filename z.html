            <h2>What tech I like</h2>
            <p>
                I am a huge fan of Raspberry Pis and have three at home one of which I am using as a webserver and is currently
                hosting a website for a class project. I have plans to build a magic mirror that is on hold till I have some free
                time. If you don't know a magic mirror is a TV with a two-way mirror over the screen and a Raspberry Pi connected to
                it. This gives the appearance that the "mirror" has words or images magically appearing. This can display weather, traffic,
                email, schedule, and a myriad other things that one could want. Another tech that I am a fan of is Spring and I am constantly
                impressed with how much it can do and how quickly an enterprise level API can be set up.

            <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>
                I met my wife in early 2015 less than a year after separating from the Air Force and have regretted it ever since
                (Just kidding!). I am lucky to have her and we have an eleven month old boy that is the happiest baby ever that
                I can't wait to teach how to program and tinker with things that I'm sure will drive his mother batty. I grew up 
                with two older brothers one of which is into technology but doesn't have the drive to pursue it while the other
                is an athletic director. Its safe to say his passion is not remotely in tech.
