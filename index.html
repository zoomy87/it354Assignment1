                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p class="pad">
                        I grew up in southern Illinois in a small town and actually hated computers. You see my Brother and father was into computers 
                        and I wanted to do something different. Turns out I shouldn't have as now I'm the one they come to for IT advice especially 
                        since I started programming. I played basketball growing up then while in high school I also got into Texas holdem and started learning
                        the math of poker, but have since forgot most. After high school I joined the Air Force and was supposed to go into Intel, but me being stupid
                        I said I wanted to leave as soon as possible instead of waiting for my job to open up. Because of that I ended up in Security Forces and 
                        became a cop and that lead me to do nuclear security, anti-terrorism, and various training. After eight years I separated from the Air Force 
                        with no plan other than knowing that I wanted to do something different. It was during this that I met my wife and she was
                        a Catastrophe adjuster for State Farm. I traveled to a few places with her like California, and I spent about a year trying
                        different things and I eventually bought a book on programming that I really enjoyed. Then I went to Free Code Camp and just dove into web
                        development and loved it. I built my own computer and enrolled at Indiana State University in the Computer Science program
                        was introduced to C. I liked C as the logic made sense and everything was spelled by the language where many other
                        languages abstract and hide complexity. Eventually my wife accepted a promotion that led us here to Illinois State University
                        where I transfered into IS Web Application Development due to some classes not transferring and I didn't want to spend more
                        time in college than necessary.

                        <p>
                            Most of what I've done is play around with various web technologies like Wordpress and Xamp. I've built
                            a couple different websites but most of them have been static sites with only a couple being server side.
                            What I've built has been mainly school projects such as the LinkU from IT 353. I have built a little bit 
                            of a blog like site that is built using the Spring framework. I used the Spring Framework at State Farm, which
                            is also where I had to learn it for my internship, and was very surprised at how complex and robust it is.
                            The team I was working with were using it to create Virtual Machines and then deploy it to a server for 
                            various applications. This was used by the entire enterprise and was a very fast paced and knowledge intense
                            group. I learned a lot from them and am very appreciative of the experience I recieved while there.
